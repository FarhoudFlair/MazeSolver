# MazeSolver

This android app will (solve) find a path from the starting cell to the destination wall all while being blocked off by the wall cells.

You are able to change both the starting and destination cells by clicking on them and then clicking on another cell to select it as the new spot.

After you have the start and destination cells selected you can go ahead and select any empty cell to create a Wall there that will block the path.

Walls = W
Destination = D
Start = S
E = Empty
